# Movie Library 2.0 ( React & Redux )

```
My simple Movie Library 2.0 based on my previous Movie Library Project.
This time with React-Redux and Thunk, with Material UI.
I wish i refactored this more, but the more i do it, the redux in this project will be removed.
```
```
You can also use this as PWA or Mobile App because of service worker just tap the Add to home screen and it's good to do.
